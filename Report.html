      <p>The website was finally modernized. It had a few issues which needed to be changed to complete it's modernization.</p>

      <p>First we changed the general appearance of the website. The primary color we went for was a dark grey tone which is similar to the dark tones in the Restaurant</p>

      <p>The other thing we changed was the location of elements such as the links to th menu page and other pages. The links we not well visible</p>

      <p>In all our changes mobile responsiveness was our priority. In the modern age where most websites are accessed through mobile phones, we had to ensure that the site was available to mobile users.</p>

      <p> We added a few images in the About Us page that did not come with the project files. This were meant to break the monotony of the site. The attribution to this images are linked below </p>
